This project is my last step in the computer engineering degree at the FIB. Its purpose is to reflect all the knowledge learned during this period.
The project is about the development of a survival video game named GENLAND. This is characterized by having an infinite world generated procedurally where its members evolve through genetic algorithms. The game is programmed in C ++ with the help of the multimedia library SFML.
